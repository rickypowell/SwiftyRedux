# Redux

This is a homegrown solution for Redux in swift for the project. Below is examples on how to use it.

## Store

The `ReduxStore` holds all the state. When the dispatch method is called, then it iterates through all of it's given reducers which can mutate
the state. This cycle is meant to repeat until every reducer has finished executing and all subscribers have received the state updates.

At the same time, it appends a historic record between reducer mutations (microHistory) and a then finally a
record is created after all reducers have finished. If the state is `Equatable`, then after each reducer has executed, it's output is compared with the
previous state. If it's different, then the new state is published to the subscribers. Otherwise, the next reducer is executed. Subscibers will not receive
an update until a new state is output.

## State

That that is equatable is preferred because it can be conditionally tested if the state has changed or not and published to the subscribers

## Dispatch and Action

Actions assist in the dispatch of potentially new state and implement `ReduxAction`. Calling `ReduxStore.dispatch(_:)` requires
that you pass in a `ReduxAction`. For every action, the `ReduxStore` iterates through all the reducers and publishes
the changes to the subscribers.

### Example
```
/// Actions

struct Increment: ReduxAction {}
struct Decrement: ReduxAction {}

/// Reducers

func counterLogReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Int) -> Int {
    print("action: \(action), state: \(state)")
    return state
}

func counterReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Int) -> Int {
    switch action {
    case is Increment:
        return state + 1
    case is Decrement:
            return state - 1
    default:
        return state
    }
}

func counterReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Int?) -> Int? {
    guard let value = state else { return state }
    switch action {
    case is Increment:
        return value + 1
    case is Decrement:
        return value - 1
    default:
        return state
    }
}

// create a store
let opInt: Int = 2
let intStore = createStore(initialState: opInt, counterReducer)
// create a subscription
intStore.subscribe { (state: Int) in
    let x = state
    print(x)
}
intStore.subscribe { [weak intStore] _ in
    if let history = intStore?.history {
        print(history)
    }
}
// dispatch some actions
intStore.dispatch(action: Increment())
intStore.dispatch(action: Increment())
intStore.dispatch(action: Decrement())
intStore.dispatch(action: Increment())
intStore.dispatch(action: Increment())

// Custom type

struct TodayIsBirthday: ReduxAction {}
struct EatGrapes: ReduxAction {}
struct PurchaseBear: ReduxAction {}
struct PurchaseGoldfish: ReduxAction {}

struct Pet: Equatable {
    let name: String
    let numberOfLegs: Int
}

struct Human: Equatable, CustomDebugStringConvertible {

    var age: Int
    var hunger: String
    var pets: [Pet] = []
    init(age: Int, hunger: String) {
        self.age = age
        self.hunger = hunger
    }
    
    var debugDescription: String {
        return "<Human age=\(age), hunger=\(hunger), pets=\(pets) />"
    }
}

func humanLogger(action: ReduxAction, state: Human) -> Human {
    print("ü§ñ logging human <\(state) />")
    return state
}

func birthdayReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Human) -> Human {
    var mutableState = state
    switch action {
    case is TodayIsBirthday:
        mutableState.age += 1
        return mutableState
    default:
        return state
    }
}

func haveSnackReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Human) -> Human {
    var mutableState = state
    switch action {
    case is EatGrapes:
        mutableState.hunger = "satisfied"
        return mutableState
    default:
        return state
    }
}

func petStoreReducer(action: ReduxAction, state: Human) -> Human {
    var mutableState = state
    switch action {
    case is PurchaseBear:
        mutableState.pets.append(Pet(name: "üêª Bear", numberOfLegs: 4))
        return mutableState
    case is TodayIsBirthday:
        mutableState.pets.append(Pet(name: "üéÇ Goldfish", numberOfLegs: 0))
        return mutableState
    case is PurchaseGoldfish:
        mutableState.pets.append(Pet(name: "üê† Goldfish", numberOfLegs: 0))
        return mutableState
    default:
        return state
    }
    
}

// create store
let humanStore = createStore(
    initialState: Human(age: 0, hunger: "very"),
    birthdayReducer, petStoreReducer, haveSnackReducer
)
// subscribe to changes
humanStore.subscribe { state in
    let v = state
    print(v.age)
    v.age
    v.pets.map { $0.name }
}
humanStore.subscribe { [weak humanStore] state in
    if let h = humanStore?.history {
        h
    }
    if let m = humanStore?.microHistory {
        m
    }
}
// dispacth actions
humanStore.dispatch(action: TodayIsBirthday())
humanStore.dispatch(action: PurchaseBear())
humanStore.dispatch(action: PurchaseGoldfish())
humanStore.dispatch(action: TodayIsBirthday())
humanStore.dispatch(action: EatGrapes())
